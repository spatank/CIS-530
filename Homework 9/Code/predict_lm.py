'''
predict_lm.py

Predict the condition of subjects based on their tweets and pre-trained
language models.

The script takes as input:
- a SPLIT (can be one of train/dev/test)
- a CONDITION_POS language model file (trained using train_lm.py)
- a CONDITION_NEG language model file
- an OUTFILE (location to write the results)

The script should write to OUTFILE an ordered list of subjects from
the chosen dataset split, where subjects at the top of the list
are most likely to have CONDITION_POS and those at the bottom are
most likely to have CONDITION_NEG based on their tweets and
the two language models.

Usage:

python predict_lm.py <SPLIT> <CONDITION_POS_MODEL> <CONDITION_NEG_MODEL> <OUTFILE>
